The quickest way to run this program is to:
	1. Open 'TechChallenge' in Intellij (or any other Java IDE)
	2. select Java version to Java 11+ (the program uses some features from Java 11 so it's important to set the correct version)
	3. Import all the libraries that have been used in pom.xml file (Intellij has an 'Auto-Import' which makes this step really
	   easy which is why I recommend it)
	4. Run TechChallengeApplication Main

This will setup a springboot server on your localhost, send the request 'borderInfo?curreny=' to your localhost IP
